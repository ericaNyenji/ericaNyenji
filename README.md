ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Erica Mary Nyenji, and I'm passionate about coding. Graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science on July 2025 at  EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University. I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of technology.

ðŸ’» Exploring various programming languages and concepts keeps me engaged, and I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.

ðŸŒ± As I continue to learn and grow, I'm excited about the prospect of collaborating with IT companies to contribute to meaningful projects and gain valuable industry experience.

ðŸ“§ Feel free to reach out to me at nyenjierica@gmail.comâ€” I'm open to discussions, collaborations, and connecting with fellow enthusiasts in the field.

âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time, I enjoy exploring new coding challenges with my friends and experimenting with different programming techniques!
              I also really enjoy journalingðŸ˜€.

Looking forward to connecting and exploring the exciting possibilities together! ðŸš€
